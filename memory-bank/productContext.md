# Product Context

The problem this server solves is bridging the gap between LLMs and specific document knowledge bases within the MCP ecosystem. Standard LLMs lack access to private or domain-specific documents. This RAG server allows users to index their own documents (text, markdown, JSON, CSV) and make that information accessible to LLMs through MCP tools.

This enhances the LLM's ability to answer questions accurately based on the provided documents, improving utility for tasks requiring specific knowledge retrieval.
